              This section contains my ongoing research notes, vulnerability analysis, and penetration testing methodologies. 
              I document various attack vectors, defensive strategies, and emerging threats in the cybersecurity landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
              Key areas of focus include:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
              <li>Web application security testing procedures</li>
              <li>Network penetration testing methodologies</li>
              <li>Malware analysis and reverse engineering techniques</li>
              <li>Social engineering attack vectors and prevention</li>
              <li>Zero-day vulnerability research and disclosure</li>
              <li>Incident response and forensic investigation processes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These notes serve as both a personal knowledge base and a resource for the cybersecurity community. 
              Regular updates include new attack patterns, defense mechanisms, and industry best practices.
